## About me

> I would like to call myself a strong and independent person, but I would be lying if I said that. Hence my main goal - the pursuit of responsibility and independence. Since the very word independence imperceptibly brings us to the financial side of the issue, my priority at the moment is learning JavaScript and Spanish(because I want to), as well as improving my physical and moral health. All my sides, depending on their concentration per square millimeter, can be attributed to both weak and strong, but I do my best every second of my studing and work life

## Skills

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
